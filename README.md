WP Exploit Scanner by k0ur1i
WP Exploit Scanner is a comprehensive tool for scanning, detecting, and exploiting vulnerabilities in WordPress websites. It integrates multiple functionalities, including Shodan and ZoomEye searches, Nuclei scanning, auto-exploitation, and the ability to import custom exploit scripts.

Features
WordPress Vulnerability Scanning: Detect vulnerabilities in WordPress installations.
Shodan Integration: Search for WordPress-related systems using Shodan.
ZoomEye Integration: Search for WordPress-related systems using ZoomEye.
Nuclei Scanning: Use Nuclei templates to identify CVEs, misconfigurations, and WordPress-specific issues.
Auto-Exploitation: Automatically exploit known vulnerabilities.
Custom Exploit Import: Dynamically import and execute Python exploit scripts.


Requirements :
Python Dependencies :
- Install the necessary Python libraries:

- pip install requests pyfiglet rich shodan
Additional Tools
Shodan API Key
ZoomEye API Key
Nuclei:
Install Nuclei and configure its path in the script.



Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/00xk0uR1i/k0URI.git
cd wpk0ur1i-Exploiter
Configure the script:

Add your Shodan API key:
SHODAN_API_KEY = "your_shodan_api_key"
Add your ZoomEye API key (if applicable).
Configure the Nuclei path and templates.



Run the script:

python k0ur1i.py --help
Usage
General Syntax
python k0ur1i.py [OPTIONS]
Options
--target: Specify the target WordPress site URL.
--shodan: Perform a Shodan search for WordPress-related systems.
--zoomeye: Perform a ZoomEye search for WordPress-related systems.
--nuclei: Scan the target with Nuclei.
--exploit: Attempt to auto-exploit known vulnerabilities.
--import-exploit: Import and execute a custom Python exploit script.


Examples:
Scan a WordPress site for vulnerabilities:

python k0uR1i.py --target "http://example.com"
Perform a Shodan search for WordPress sites:

python k0ur1i.py --shodan
Scan with Nuclei:

python k0ur1i.py --target "http://example.com" --nuclei
Automatically exploit vulnerabilities:

python k0ur1i.py --target "http://example.com" --exploit
Import and run a custom exploit script:

python k0ur1i.py --target "http://example.com" --import-exploit "/path/to/exploit.py"


Example Exploit Script
Hereâ€™s an example of a custom exploit script that can be imported and executed:

def run_exploit(target):
    print(f"Running custom exploit on {target}")
    # Add exploit logic here
    response = requests.get(f"{target}/vulnerable_endpoint")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Exploit succeeded! Response: {response.text}")
    else:
        print("Exploit failed.")
